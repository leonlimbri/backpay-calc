# Backpay Calculator
Due to recent change in EBA (Enterprise Bargaining Agreement) rates for nurses allowances on the on-calls,
some hospital doesn't calculate this backpays automatically for all nurses.

This simple app is trying to mitigate miscalculation of nurses' calculated backpay for their allowances
on on-calls. Note that the alllowances are updated as of the table in [link](https://www.anmfvic.asn.au/~/media/files/anmf/eba2024/resources/241101-allowancestable-5.pdf)

Lastly, the calculated backpay is assuming that the nurses are using the same timetable format with
the one in Royal Children Hospital, and the timesheets can be downloaded as a csv file.
